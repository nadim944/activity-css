    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Pablo Lobato</strong></em>, born in <em>Trelewem, Patagonia Argentina</em> in 1970, is a graphic designer and illustrator.Not being very good at sports he used to spend long hours drawing superheros and medieval knights, instead of playing soccer like his friends.</p>

<p>In 1982 he drew his first portrait, an illustration of <em>Cesar Luis Menotti</em>, the coach of the national soccer team at that moment.
Everybody seemed to like it, so <em><strong>Pablo</strong></em>  decided that this was his thing. But he did not want to be a painter, he admired the artist Uderzo, not Cezanne, as Fine Arts was too much, but graphic design could be a good choice to keep on drawing while paying the bills.</p>
